# CMP307 Software Engineering Practice

CMP307 coursework required a message application to learn how systems are built from brief, requirements, diagrams, design, implementation, testing, and security.
The project is organised in a MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure to separate the UI from the business logic.

The submission was graded an A+ as it met all the coursework requirements. In retrospect, the communication between two users was implemented badly due to the recurring query execution to the MySQL database every second to check for new messages. It would have been a better choice to use sockets.
